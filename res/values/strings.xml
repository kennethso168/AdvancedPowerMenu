	<string name="troubleshoot_content">What can you do if the app doesn\'t work / if issue happens?\n\nStep 1: Try fixing it yourself\n1. Make sure that you have read the prerequisites and installation guide thoroughly/\n2. Reboot your phone TWICE (TWO TIMES)\nFor every single xposed mod, a reboot after installation is necessary. But that might not be enough as users have reported that the app doesn\'t work after a single reboot, but things get right when they reboot again. So rebooting TWICE is recommended\n3. Disable all other Xposed Mod\nXposed framework do take care of mods that hook the same method, but sometimes conflicts can still happen. Try disabling all mods except mine in the Xposed Installer. Then reboot and see if things get right.\n4. Clear app data/reinstalling my app\nThe settings may get messed up when my app updates, so try reinstalling and see if it helps.\n5. Use an older version of my app\nTry this and see if it helps. If so that means a new update breaks something old and please tell me about that!\nIf all the above doesn\'t work, you can then send me an issue report.\n\nStep 2: Tell me and see if I can fix it\n(Please don\'t do this before doing step 1)\nPlease send me an issue report including\n1) a description of the issue\n2) screenshots (if it helps explain the situation)\n3) The device, ROM, Android OS version, and the app version\n4) debug.log (Please enable verbose logging in my app first, then do something like long-pressing the power button)(you may obtain the log in xposed installer 2.4)\n5) Anything else you think it\'s important\nthrough one of the following means:\n1) xda forum thread/PM (preferred)\n2) e-mail (NOTE: please begin your subject with [APM] so I can better sort my emails. Thanks)\nPlease note that I can\'t solve the problem with insufficient information. I will also IGNORE any email with NO BODY TEXT (I use gmail)\n\nKeep in mind that even with all the information I still may not be able to fix your problem because I do not own your device and I\'m only a novice android developer. Sorry.</string>

	<string name="email_note_content">Everyday, I am overwhelmed with tons of emails (not related to this app). Therefore, please note the following points before sending me emails.\n1. I can better notice your message if you use xda posts/PMs\n2. Please read the \"What can you do if the app doesn\'t work / if issue happens?\" before sending me an email (found in Xposed Installer > Download > Advanced Power Menu)\n3. Please begin your subject with [APM] so I can better sort my emails. Thanks.\n4. Please note that I can\'t solve the problem with insufficient information. I will also IGNORE any email with NO BODY TEXT (I use gmail).\n5. I understand only English and Chinese.\nThank you for your cooperation.</string>
